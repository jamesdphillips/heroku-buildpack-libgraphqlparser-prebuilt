#
#   Bash does not allow us to export variables that include dashes in their
#   name. Unfortunately this means that we cannot export the required
#   environment variable that Bundler expects since the Gem has a dash in it's
#   name.
#
#   To work around this we conditionally create a .bundle/config file and add
#   the build configuration for the gem.
